# mongodb-socialMedia

## Description

This project is built to practice my skills with Mongo DB.  It is a backend only project to build a basic structure for a social media application.  The app is built using two models: User and Thought.  The user also comes along with a Friend attribute and Thoughts have a Reaction.  The app will be tested and shown using Insomnia.
